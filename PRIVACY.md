# Privacy Policy for Instagram Fullscreen Viewer

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

The extension only requires the "activeTab" permission to modify the Instagram website's appearance and enable fullscreen functionality. No information is sent to any servers, and no analytics or tracking is implemented.

The extension operates entirely within your browser and only affects the Instagram website when you're actively using it.

For questions or concerns, please contact us through the Chrome Web Store support channel.
